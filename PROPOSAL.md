# User stories

AS someone who has free time after school/work 
I WANT to have something to help me look for hangout spots based on my preferences
SO THAT I can choose a spot and have a good time

GIVEN I am trying to get a suggestion

WHEN I open the website
THEN I am presented with my preferred options to choose a location and a map of my current location

WHEN I choose a specific location
THEN my search and map will be updated to search from that location within a specified radius

Given a user in a specific location
they can specify the location to search from

WHEN I choose a set of preferences
THEN I will be able to choose the kind of drink, and music vibes

WHEN I choose preferences
THEN it will be saved on their local browser

WHEN I can't decide
THEN I can press a button to spin the wheel based on my preferences
