# Bar Crawler

## Description

This is a web application that allows users to easily create their own personalized bar crawl so they get to focus on having fun. The application uses the Google Places API to search for bars where they are then displayed on on a wheel that spins. The OpenWeather API is used to display the local weather so the user is prepared for their night out.

To use the application, first enter a search term into the search bar or choose one from the dropdown menu and click "FIND ME." The application will then use the Google Places API to search for bars that match your search term in your area. The results will be displayed on the wheel and in cards below.

You can click on a bar from the displayed results to get more information about it or spin the wheel. A card will appear with the bar's name, information, and website if it is available.
